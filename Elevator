# Elevator Speech

Have you ever been in a rush to go to work or school leaving you no time to stop by your favorite local boba shop for quick drink? 
I myself have experienced this problem many times. We believe something must be done. Our app aims to aid small businesses in market entry.
While bigger and more known companies such as Starbucks and McDonald's are able to afford their own app, many smaller mom n pop shops in 
the local communities do not possess this same luxury.  How our app would work would be similar to a personal website builder such as 
square space! Except instead of designing your own website, you would design your own app that would function as a way for users to 
purchase food or drinks from your company! Our app not only allows you to design, it would also keep track of user data and would be 
available to the company so they can analyze it on their own time. Overall, we simply aim to help companies get out there and become 
more available to people in such times where technology and apps are playing critical roles in sales.
